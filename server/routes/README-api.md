# Routes folder setup for API layer

## Documentation:
1. Populate "/routes/objectsRoute.js" with necessary "express", "router" & "db" data
2. Populate "/routes/objectsRoute.test.js" with tests to test "router.get", "router.post", "router.put/patch", "router.delete" functions.
3. Build relevant "router.get", "router.post", "router.put/patch", "router.delete" functions for the api layer in "/routes/objectsRoute.js" using Jest to verify code as it is built
4. Ensure "module.exports = router" is included at bottom of "/routes/objectsRoute.js"
5. Continue repo setup following "../../client/README-api.md" instructions
